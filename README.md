**Canoe Final Project**

This uses https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/laravel docker image with maria db.

I opted to use AngularJS as the frontend just because it's easy to pull in via cdn and no build process required.

I believe this meets the requirement of the pdf only in it's strictest since. I'm positive to make this truly fit the intent, would require various rounds of communication.

I followed this formula provided in the pdf _amount * (1+5%) * (1+10%)_ where every cash flow added is cumulative.
